This working solution is tested with the tree hierarchy with multiple nested levels.

Sample data used to test it is a tree structure up to nested level 3 but please feel free to add more nesting to test the accuracy of the code.

This code calculates the number of bundles  that can be created using the sub-bundles. 

Related DB schema diagram and  EF classes are included in the solution but the EF classes are not fully utilized due to time constraints.

For any clarification or discussion  over the solution, please schedule a call.
